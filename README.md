# Norns REPL-LOOPER

> Anagogically integrated UI for Norns / Matron / Grid

Experimental performance and creative tool, mashing together several things that I like. REPL for interactive code creating. Grid to have a tactile UI (maybe we'll throw in a midi pedal too). Dance between client and host, between recording loops and loops that can modify other loops and themselves.

# Installation and Usage

Install by running this on maiden:

```lua
  ;install https://github.com/awwaiid/repl-looper
```

Then start `repl-looper` on the norns. The norns screen will show some status information. Interaction is primarily done through a web-browser and grid. You can access the web interface at:

http://norns.local/api/v1/dust/code/repl-looper/ui/dist/repl-looper.html (or http://bit.ly/norns-repl-looper)

The browser interface is an alternative to maiden's REPL with a few different features and style. The basic idea is the same -- you run Lua commands and see the results. Verify that everything is running with some simple math

```lua
  2+2
```

Which should output `4` (give or take). The built-in engine is a mash-up of Timber, Goldeneye, and Molly the Poly. There is a shortcut for a Timber-based piano sample, `p`. There is also an instance of Molly pre-defined. Try these:

```lua
  -- Timber piano
  p'c'
  p'd'
  p(68)

  molly:note(60)
  molly:randomize_params()
  molly:note(62)
  molly:stop()
```

Next thing to play with is loops/sequences. There are 8 pre-defined 16-step loops, one for each row, put into variables `a`..`h`. Start by recording into loop `a`:

```lua
  a:rec()
  -- loop 'a' is now playing and recording! You can see the steps
  -- both on the grid

  p'c'
  -- now wait a bit
  p'd'
  -- the loop is playing and will wrap back around

  a:stop() -- this stops recording but keeps playing
  a:stop() -- stop again to also stop playing

  -- At this point press some of the grid buttons to trigger all the
  -- events recorded at that step immediately (ignoring their sub-step timing)

  a:lua() -- show the loop contents

  a:play() -- start loop again
  a:clear() -- erase loop contents
```

Now that you have the script running on norns and the local UI up in a browser and everything working together, read through [Techniques](techniques.lua) to get some ideas!

# Resources

* [Techniques / Tutorial](techniques.lua) to get some ideas!
* [Development Journal / Changelog](journal.md) for a running log of experiments

# Reference

## UI
* On the right is output, including errors
* Use `<up>` and `<down>` arrows to select commands and output from history
* Press `<enter>` to execute the most recent item from history
* Use `<tab>` to see what functions/methods are available
* Simple functions with no parameters are automatically evaluated, so you use `p` instead of `p()`
* Loops on the grid will be visualized as they are played, and turn red in record mode
* Common 808 samples are loaded under `s808.<tab>` and have shortcuts like `CP`

# Library and Live-Coding Helpers

* Pre-defined variables/functions
  * `a`..`h` -- loops, one per grid-row
  * `p` -- a Timber-based piano sample player
  * `piano` -- the underlying piano sample (via Timber)
    * You can do things like `piano:reverse()`
  * `molly` -- an instance of Molly, which wraps Molly The Poly
  * Pre-loaded 808 samples in `s808.*` with these shortcuts
    * `BD`, `BD`, `CH`, `CY`, `LC`, `MC`, `RS`, `BS`, `CL`, `HC`, `LT`, `MT`, `SD`, `CB`, `CP`, `HT`, `MA`, `OH`
    * Call with `CP` or `CP()` or `s808.CP:play()`
    * Modify with `s808.BS:amp(2)`
* Loop (using loop `a` as the example)
  * `Loop.new()` -- Create a new Loop (I usually use `a`..`h` pre-defined loops instead)
  * `a.current_step` -- current step (integer)
  * `a:setLength(steps)` -- Set the number of steps (quarter-notes)
  * `a:setStep(step)` -- Set the current step
  * `a:lua()` -- Convert into a lua-style string
  * `a:play()` -- Start playing
  * `a:stop()` -- Stop recording or stop playing
  * `a:rec()` -- Start recording
  * `a:clear()` -- Remove all events
  * `a:gen(code_string, condition, mod_base)` -- Generate events in a loop programmatically, with macro expansion
    * `a:gen("CH")` -- Fill each step with a `CH` event (sugar for `CH()`, sugar for `s808.CH:play()`)
    * `a:gen("SD", 3, 4)` -- Fill 3rd of every 4 steps with a `SD` event
    * `a:gen("BS", {1, 2.75, 3.5, 4.25, 4.75})` -- Fill these exact steps (substeps) with `BS` event
    * macro expansion: Backticks are evaluated for each generated event. Use `n` for the one-based step/column and `m` for the zero-based step/colum
      * ```a:gen("p(`50+m`)")``` -- Generates `p(50)`, `p(51)`, `p(52)`, etc
      * ```a:gen("piano:filterFreq(`100 * n`)")``` -- Generates low-pass for 100 hz, 200 hz, 300 hz, etc
  * `a:quantize()` -- Events are recorded at sub-steps by default; this immediately rounds them to the nearest step
  * `a:nextStep()` -- Increment the current step to the next step
  * `a:prevStep()` -- Decrement the current step to the previous step
  * `a:clone(other_loop)` -- Copy this loop onto another (empty the other out)
  * `a:merge(other_loop)` -- Merge other_loop into this one. New loop is the longest of the two, timings are merged
  * `a:split(other_loop)` -- Split the current loop, putting some events into `other_loop` and keeping some
  * `a:slice(sample_name, step_offset, step_count, width)` -- Take a Timber or Goldeneye sample and slice it
    * This is effectively a complex generator of frame-offsets in the sample playback
* Engine wrappers; once you have an instance use `t1:<tab>` to explore! Generally does what the engine does
  * `t1 = Timber.new("path/to/file.wav")` -- Timber wrapper
  * `s1 = Sample.new("path/to/file.wav")` -- Goldeneye wrapper
  * `m1 = Molly.new()` -- Molly the Poly wrapper
  * You could of course use any engine you like! Only the `Loop:slice(...)` method particularly cares

# Development

When developing you can run the UI directly on your laptop, but you'll need to use docker or install dependencies. You get live-reload of changes and such. Slightly-evil the `dist` dir is then checked in to git for serving from the norns/maiden webserver. For the UI (a VueJS app):

```sh
cd ui

# Direct
npm install
npm run dev

# OR Docker, if you like
docker-compose up
```

On the norns side we need to run the lua server-side. During dev I do it this way:

```sh
# Auto-push to norns
./util/watch-sync.sh
```

# Future Ideas

* Grid on screen
  * Show events
  * Click to do the same thing as the grid button press?
* Mash up editor and REPL
  * Like a notebook but worse
  * Let the code edit the code
  * Constant fzf-style autocomplete
* Loop Recording / Editing Modes
  * Step first: Pick a step and record an event
  * Event sequencing: Take an event and place (or edit) the location of the event
  * Edit mode where a button-press loads all (timed) events for editing
* Sync loops together better?
