# Norns REPL-LOOPER

> Anagogically integrated UI for Norns / Matron / Grid

Experimental performance and creative tool, mashing together several things that I like. REPL for interactive code creating. Grid to have a tactile UI (maybe we'll throw in a midi pedal too). Dance between client and host, between recording loops and loops that can modify other loops and themselves.

# Usage

Optimizing for my own local development currently, but you can give it a try if you want. Should be something like this:

```sh
cd ui

# Direct
npm install
npm run dev

# OR Docker, if you like
docker-compose up
```

On the norns side we need to run the lua server-side. During dev I do it this way:

```sh
# Auto-push to norns
./util/watch-sync.sh
```

* 2021-09-19 <img src="docs/20210919-screenshot.png" align="right" width="50%" border=1 />
  * Sketched out basic idea last night
  * Have some diagrams in my notebook too
  * Can send/receive REPL commands via websockets
  * Next need to get (probably quantized) recording going
  * Idea is to maybe use Lattice, so I guess one pattern per event
  * Once a loop is recorded, make that a variable on the host itself (even though it was recorded on the client kinda)
* 2021-10-02
  * Messing with [websocketd](https://github.com/joewalnes/websocketd) for testing
  * Running `websocketd --port 5555 sh -c 'lua -i 2>&1'`
* 2021-10-09 <img src="docs/20211009-demo-basic-loop.gif" align="right" width="50%" border=1 />
  * Got some basic recording working in UI
  * Setting this up to start building the norns-lua side in the same repo
  * Just came up with a clever double-JSON-encoding to send loops client->server
  * I probably shouldn't be so pleased with myself
  * I got loops sending AND turned into lattice patterns!
  * A fun part of that was using negative time offsets for the pattern starts
  * I'm moving this toward assuming an overall 16-step sequence, but not necessarily quantized yet
  * Next some UX improvements; command history is definitely one
  * Sweet ... got it adjusted to play back on the first loop
  * Used [peek](https://github.com/phw/peek) to record this cool gif
* 2021-10-10
  * Last night I dreamed about loops playing loops. Good.
  * Made loops variable length (quantize later!)
  * Run `nodemon --exec ./util/sync.sh -w repl-looper.lua` to auto eval server code
  * Re-worked a bunch of calculations and gave them better labels
  * Next up is getting to record multiple loops, and then sync between them!
* 2021-10-11
  * Show the current loop position on The Grid!
  * Turn the lua Loop into an actual object, reorganize
  * Maybe instead of `loops[1]` I should flatten it to `l1`. Kinda evil but I kinda like it. We'll see
  * OK... while doing that I was looking at maybe using single-letter vars. Well I went through looking at their values one by one and typed in `q` and apparently that shuts down norns. Sooo I guess don't use that one
  * Now going to use 'a'..'h' for shortcuts (avoid 'q'!)
* 2021-10-15 <img src="docs/20211015-screenshot.png" align="right" width="50%" border=1 />
  * Refactored loop a bit so the lattice+patterns can be updated
  * Built a quantizer (in-place for now)
  * The idea is to start building some loop inspection and modification tools. Then we could loop over loops and do things to them on each loop
  * Also inversed the colors some, we'll see how I like that as we go. I mean... it's gotta LOOK cool too, right?
  * Also made a script to hold the watch+sync command so I don't have to remember it
* 2021-10-16
  * If we have a fixed-length loop when recording, then we should play back the loop events already recorded when we loop around. Right now the loop isn't sent to the norns until the end when it is fully formed. Tricky.
  * Another recording mode should be that you select the step and THEN record the event, like a step sequencer instead of a loop recorder
  * A similar record mode would be you have one event and then you place it at different steps of different loops! Even MORE like a sequencer. snare kick snare kick
  * Got visualizing a loop+events working on the grid
* 2021-10-23
  * Couple things over the week -- one big one is that now you can grid button press to manually trigger events! This worked WAY better than I expected. I think because the engine is non-blocking, with simple note playing it is very responsive and you can play multiple notes at once and all that
  * Also doing the `load` right on a string all the time seems fine so far. If need be I can cache the resulting function later
  * I've now moved the loop-recording over to lua, which should let us go a bit meta (triggering recording/playback from within a recording loop, for example)
  * Got more than one loop recording and playback! And made cool single-letter shortcuts. So you start right off with a..h (8 loops) ready to go
  * Hmm. If I'm playing back a loop and recording a loop at the same time ... I think right now it'll record the playback. Feedback loop. Probably a cool mode, but would be a weird default
  * OK, I made a new loop flag called `record_feedback` that decides what to do there, default false. Manually triggered events look the same as hand-typed ones currently
* 2021-10-24
  * Added basic sequence editing. Now you can go into sequence-edit mode, select a step, and then when you press other buttons it will toggle those commands at those buttons -- basically paste or delete
  * Kinda neat, but it does ALL the commands -- so it copies/pastes/erases them all. Not sure how to make it more granular, but it could at least not erase other commands
  * New mantra elaborating on Mrs Denton's wise words:
    * Loops Are Fun!
    * Globals Are Evil!
    * => Loopy Globals Are Evil Fun!
  * One of these days I need to work on the "music" bit haha
* 2021-11-18
  * I've added SO MANY THINGS since the last update!
  * Tonight I added tab-completion!!!
  * Let's see.... what else have I added ....
  * History, playing samples, Timber, a piano shortcut, cross-loop recording
  * I've started to practice being musical with Timber, I made this cool super low-frequencing slow throbbing sound that I call Dragon's Breath. But I don't remember how
  * I'm wrapping some OOP around Timber samples and voices

# Ideas

* Code editor like maiden w/ ctrl+enter send
* Grid on screen
  * Buttons are spread out over spacetime
  * The grid is good at visualizing and selecting spacetime
  * Buttons contain events
  * Record a loop assigns the whole thing to a button or a row
  * Physical grid button triggers event
  * Maybe visualize grid on-screen too?
* Mash up editor and REPL
  * Like a notebook but worse
  * Let the code edit the code
  * Expand a variable into the actual values -- so like a random beat generator that then becomes a hard-coded beat
  * Constant fzf-style autocomplete
* Make this thing static so that it is easy to run
  * Keep all state on the Norns
* Loop Recording / Editing Modes
  * Live REPL: Record REPL timing, construct sequence of events
    * Playback: With or without fixed-length active loop playback
  * Step first: Pick a step and record an event
  * Event sequencing: Take an event and place (or edit) the location of the event
