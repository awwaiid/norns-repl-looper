# Norns REPL-LOOPER

Weirdly integrated UI for Norns / Matron

# Ideas

* Code editor like maiden w/ ctrl+enter send
* Grid on screen
  * Buttons are spread out over spacetime
  * Buttons contain events
  * Record a loop assigns the whole thing to a button or a row
  * Physical grid button triggers event
* Mash up editor and REPL
  * Like a notebook but worse
  * Let the code edit the code
  * Expand a variable into the actual values -- so like a random beat generator that then becomes a hard-coded beat
* Make this thing static so that it is easy to run
  * Keep all state on the Norns

# Shout Outs

* Gr√©gory Montigny for icon
